# udacity-pitchPerfect
Pitch Perfect app for iOS. Developed as a project for the iOS Developer Nanodegree of Udacity.

The project consists of an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.
